So i have started writing using GitBook, to take notes of what i learn every day. a few things have shown up.
1. There are some required files if you start from a GitHub repository that you will have to create:
    * README.md
    * SUMMARY.md
2. Markdown is partially working as per escape characters don't work with # and numbering and listing get confused if they are.
