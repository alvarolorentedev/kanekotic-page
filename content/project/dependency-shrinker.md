## Mission
a command line tool to check what dependencies of an executable are really critical and not
## Installation
```
npm install dependency-shrinker
```
## use

this command will list the runtime dependencies that can be possible removed (will only detect the ones that will cause a crash if removed).
```
depshrink list <Path to executable> <boot time> [Paths to dependencies folders]
```
## Warning
if you kill the process of the command line tool at any point of execution you might end up in a situation where a dependency is missing. 

I will not take resposability on the issues generated by this package, so use at your own risk and make sure you backup all before using. And use with caution.
