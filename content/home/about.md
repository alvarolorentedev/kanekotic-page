# Biography

Code dreamer, Continious Creator of random stuff and global sharer, 

I code for living but also for fun. It sounds like random word put together, but it really describes me. I spend the day thinking what things can work together and make my life easier, and after thinking it I will just go and implement & share them as packages or services. Because there is no value in something we cannot all enjoy.
