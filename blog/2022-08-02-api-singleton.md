Human are a expectable result being, we want simple thinks we can relate to, and communication is no different, if its not natural or complex we tend to rechasar it.
This naturality is in part why the singleton pattern was so widely overused. Humans have a requirement of feeling they are in control, in this case the control of the entity you speak to, example of this is you will preffer to speak with a friend about your issue than actually go around on the street talking with anyone because you will be unable to control who this entity will comunicate your message to in the future.
The web has a similar control pattern that we relate to as humans, always been powered by servers and architectures have been normally been based on a request/response expectation. I think normally because we are used to this as humans, when you talk to someone you expect them to answer.
Now every single web has their own api, specially due the proliferations of SPA, this became a must have, but is this what every web/service requires to comunicate with fellow machines? and with humans?
