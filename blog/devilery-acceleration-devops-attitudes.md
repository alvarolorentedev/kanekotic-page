When we start our journey towards continuous integration & delivery, the first thing to take in count is the mentality. There are a few of them that will make or break our intent. Let's see the most important and also some practices.

## Mentality

### You build it, you run it

> create a DevOps culture, not a Devs vs Ops

This mentality is the idea that the same people who develop the software re in charge to maintain it in good health by observing it.

For many years, this was not the case. Operations & development were handled by different teams. This caused a dystopian situation where each group had a different goal:

* **Devs**: deliver as fast as possible. By pushing code to production without observing the side effects of it.
* **Ops**: keep system stability.

With the 'you build it, you run it' mentality, devs focus on their service or work, while Ops becomes a product team that focus on providing the correct tooling for Developers.

This affect the DORA 4 in then next way:

* ✔️ **Deployment frequency**:
* ✔️ **Lead Time for change**: 
* ✔️ **Mean Time To Recovery**: 
* ✔️ **Change Failure Rate**:

###  Be a Boy Scout

> Don’t continue the same path if you think something can be done better

As individuals, need to bring change to our products. If we see any new practice, tool, services… that can support the work of the team, bring it forward. Don't shy away because the team is currently doing it.

This affect the DORA 4 in then next way:

* ✔️ **Deployment frequency**:
* ✔️ **Lead Time for change**: 
* ✔️ **Mean Time To Recovery**: 
* ✔️ **Change Failure Rate**:

### Learn & Adapt

Not everything is solved in the same way, don't follow:

> If your only tool is a hammer then every problem looks like a nail

For this, learn and take your time for it. When you have a new problem, as it's possible, you don't have the correct tool in your toolbox. 

This affect the DORA 4 in then next way:

* ✔️ **Deployment frequency**:
* ✔️ **Lead Time for change**: 
* ✔️ **Mean Time To Recovery**: 
* ✔️ **Change Failure Rate**:
