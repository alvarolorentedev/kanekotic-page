            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human are a expectable result being, we want simple thinks we can relate to, and communication is no different, if its not natural or complex we tend to rechasar it.
This naturality is in part why the singleton pattern was so widely overused. Humans have a requirement of feeling they are in control, in this case the control of the entity you speak to, example of this is you will preffer to speak with a friend about your issue than actually go around on the street talking with anyone because you will be unable to control who this entity will comunicate your message to in the future.
The web has a similar control pattern that we relate to as humans, always been powered by servers and architectures have been normally been based on a request/response expectation. I think normally because we are used to this as humans, when you talk to someone you expect them to answer.
Now every single web has their own api, specially due the proliferations of SPA, this became a must have, but is this what every web/service requires to comunicate with fellow machines? and with humans?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[In the world of microservices testing rules have changed]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a long time we have all refered to the test piramid as a normal piramid, but is this the correct shape? should unit tests run always in complete isolation?
When unit testing, dependencies tend to be moved to their own responsible portions of code. This latter on is passed into other portions of code that will use it, this is basee on the principle of inversion of control. This is great becuase we want classes or functions to do single things, and do it right.
Sometimes dependency injection becomes an obsession and we generate unrequired layers, adapters, helpers, etc. This overengineering was necesary on the past to have fully tested code as external interactions where complex and costly to simulate.
Nowadays this is not an issue anymore with docker and databases that can simulate real behaviour in memory.
, so how do we make sure that logic embeded in queries are correct? or interactions with other services are correct?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The over-engineering of our age]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cloud services and infrastructure as code during the last decade have revolutionized our industry, they have allowed us to be able to procure infrastructure in a very simple way and adaptable to the needs based on traffic. This allowed us to move from writing humongous monolithic applications to write smaller applications that run in their own infrastructure and communicate between themselves.
One of the most accepted definition of a microservice can be expressed as:
A self-contained portion of code that do not share resources with other services, can be deployed independently and should be easy to rewrite in a small portion of time.
This sounds actually great when we talk about individual parts of a software projects. I was definetly sold on it after understanding that definition.
Nevertheless when thinking about systems and how they operate. There is a point to make about granularity as software does never work on complete isolated units. It requires interactions to fullfill their purpose.
Most of the monolithic applications of the past had an issue of being over-engineered to allow changes that might never happen. Could that happen also with infrastructure? Is it currently a real problem for delivery?</p><p>Lost Overview Of The Domain
When a system grows to much in small pieces, it becomes more and more complex to have an overview of the goal of the moving parts. When pieces are to small domain events start becoming exchange of information in between nodes of a network. All this removes cohesion on the knowledge over the domain of a system, making it difficult to grasp the real intention and capabilities of concepts and actors across a system.</p><p>Why… if YAGNI
One of the main ideas of micro-services was to be able to validate assumptions fast. Before bootstrapping new services or infrastructure, there is a need to ask ourselves about the existence of a service or infrastructure that contains the domain knowledge required for the experiment in the current ecosystem.
If we are not careful experiments wont be experiments. They will be MVPs, where domain knowledge is re-implemented, just for the sake of have it as a standalone node on the system.</p><p>Repeating Yourself
When we create pieces of code that are independent there is always a certain level of bootstrapping that is required and repeated in each nodes of our systems.
This will cause not only a set of duplicated code, but also has a development time cost attached to it. Bootstraping a project in a high granularity system can be complex to standardize.</p><p>Babel tower Issue
The more parts a system has, the less heterogeneous it becomes. This at the same time translates into a more complex environment with more integration's, frameworks and bigger learning curves that affects delivery. There need to be a balance of when and where in a system a new technology is added. Decisions need to be based on needs and not on preferences.</p><p>Implicit runtime dependencies
The more a system get split the more dependency on certain node it will have. This tend to cause more dependencies in between the pieces of your infrastructure based puzzle where you start having god infrastructure points that become single point of failure, or you have chain of dependent infra that need to be deployed in a go or certain order.</p><p>Hidden Complexity
The more your microservice environment grows the more it requires a growing support infrastructure for monitoring, alerting and other services not used as part of the main system. This normally is a separate effort and has its own cost. The more a system grows those hidden complexities become a dependency for all the nodes in the system, making it a complex task to evolve and change those dependencies.</p><p>Microservices, the cloud and infrastructure as a service have definitely revolutionized our industry, nevertheless as everything there is a need for balance. Making sure we use the right tool for the job and we don't over-engineer things, not only at a code level but also at infrastructure level, as everything has a cost.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kanekotic.com/blog/2022/08/02/resource-process-microservices</link>

            <description><![CDATA[Resource VS Process Microservices]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the last decade micro-services have been taking traction in the development world. Nevertheless moving from a monolithic view to a more self-served set of pieces is not an easy mental migration.
I have seen in my experience two different approaches with two very different outcomes. One is based on resources and the other one is based on process.
The resource approach is based on the idea of Object Orientation. Meaning everything should be abstracted as an object that can be manipulated overtime by the consumers of that resource. In this approach the Data is on the drivers seat.
The process approach is based on the more functional view of the world. Meaning data is transform as part of a process to achieve a specific end. In this approach the Process is on the drivers seat.
this has ramification at a few different levels.
Resource Approach
This approach makes simple to understand concepts, but tends to be very chatty and cause a high cognitive load when understanding the overal interactins. It requires either an interface to the outside world that orchestrates all the calls. Or it requires the consumer to know all the required resources and do the process on their side.
Independence
The orchestration approach, requires normally to sync different microservices and teams. This will most of the time require a set of calls that are synchronous to retrieve the correct information to query another micro-service.
This brings to the picture a concept that Jonas Boner calls microliths in this article. The idea is that if you have synchronous calls in between services to serve information, services are not independent, and cant not be treated as individual pieces.
This has the side effect that releasing microservices cant be achieved as independent pieces, ending up in releases at absurd times where it wont affect customers and a lot of environments due the complex understanding of stability of services. Causing longer release cycles and more heavy process required.
Domain Understanding
The resource view makes it very simple to understand individual pieces, and the domain of teams becomes that individual resources. This causes a need of a different layer of Domain Understanding in the orchestrator or the consuming applications. That can cause a cognitive overload.
Normally this environments require a lot of overlook from an environment perspective as they are based on having sources ofd true for each abstraction of the data. The more an environment growths the more the cognitive overload will be there causing a possible misalignment.
Business Organization
This approach normally causes an organization to be a layared one as the vertical separation is not possible, due the need to sync multiple resources. This affects at the same time independence of teams. As a team cant own from an understanding perspective any user process view, due the lack of the business domain understanding.
Process Approach
The process approach tends to be more self contained its based on the idea that duplicated data is not an issue. You do not have a source of true for the resource, what you have is a chain of custody of that resource data.
Independence
Communication on this systems normally happen through queues and teams are in charge of specific process. Based on this idea, the indirection layer provided by this allows teams and service to be in control of their own environment and have a lower amount of external dependencies simplifying.

I am specifically talking about <code>Pull Requests</code>. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-prs-exist">Why PR's exist<a class="hash-link" href="#why-prs-exist" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Pull requests exist mostly as a practice accepted for <code>zero trust environments</code> (ex. Open Source). An attack vector on this type of environments is the ability of anyone to contribute meaning you could inject code that could create know vulnerabilities that packages will inherit. That is why maintainers validate code from unknown people.</p><p>Also PR's exist for highly distributed teams (around the clock) as a way to do knowledge sharing. If someone in side A of the world can follow and understand the changes for a feature that is being developed in side B of the world.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issue">The issue<a class="hash-link" href="#the-issue" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Currently most teams even if they work in the same office or timezone work in this PR way.
A team should be a trust environment as we all have the same goal as we are bound by the same context. Meaning our team members are not the origin of an attack vector.
If we talk about knowledge sharing. There tend to be more efficient solutions like over the shoulder reviews or also pair programming.
With this 2 points we would be at parity with the PR value. Nevertheless PR's have a hidden cost in trust environments. One of this costs is related to ownership. Writing code that is broken in a branch does not affect anyone, at the same point some of the responsibility of validation goes to the reviewer that without the specifics need to validate if things are correct or not. We know humans suck at this, so why not let this to machines handle the responsibility?
The other hidden cost can be measure in throughput. PR's tend to wait and accumulate the more complex a change is the more it takes to merge it. Meaning the more time it takes to get to production. This does not only happens with features but also with fixes, meaning you can go from a capability of response time of minutes to hours.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-alternative">The Alternative<a class="hash-link" href="#the-alternative" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A lot of people would have already heard about <code>Trunk based development</code>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a member of the community that like to generate npm packages like libraries and cli tools, sometimes is difficult to maintain everything and keep your package up to date in the dependencies side. I am a fan of having static dependencies as versioning is not being held correctly in most of the npm world. So if you dont use exact packages you could run in the issue that a broken change makes from the night to the morning your awesome tool to break.</p><p>This practice could bring a headache to keep dependencies up to date because is a manual process. And manual process tend to be time consuming (at this point in time I have ~17 npm packages) meaning that if i want to simply do normal maintenance i will have to run everything for all those in maybe weekly or monthly bases. </p><p>So is a bit of a no situation for maintainers, but if you dont maintain your package people will not use it, because there is a concern about how active the project is, even if there are no open issues. For solving both of this things what i have decided is to ad to my CI/CD pipeline a script that runs only on cron jobs from travis ci.</p><div class="language-yml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0

            <description><![CDATA[Create your User/Organization GitHub Page with Hugo + Travis]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished migrating my static blog from Hexo to Hugo and one of the main things I care about is to be able to do continuous deployment of my profile and blog. There are quite a few blog posts out there but they are based on using shell scripts and it really becomes a pain to give permissions etc. In the next few lines you will see the simplest way I have found to do this (and is currently as this blog post is being published).</p><p>You will need to have:</p><ul><li>A Github account.</li><li>A Travis CI account.</li><li>A Github repository with source code of your web page with Hugo (*1)</li><li>A Github repository with the name <code>&lt;your User or Organization&gt;.github.com</code> (ex. kanekotic.github.com) (*2).</li><li>A developer token from GitHub with commit capabilities (can create in github <code>Settings -&gt; Developer Settings -&gt; Personal Access Token -&gt; Generate New Token</code> )</li></ul><p>I wont cover how to create a Hugo web page as this is best explained in the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick start</a>) of Hugo.</p><p>After you are happy with the content of your blog in the repository of source code (*1), and want to start deploying you will need to add a <code>.travis.yml</code> with the next content</p><div class="language-yml
