I am currently starting some new open-source projects and I feel it is tedious to do some recurrent tasks. For example: 

* Promote this blog post in social media 
* Announce a new release.

[Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/) & [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) integrations allow just this, by a process of action and reaction.

 These systems provide:

* **Triggers**: they are the starting point of what will happen after.
* **Actions**: they react to previous steps on the described flow.
