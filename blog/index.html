itemprop="articleBody"><p>The singleton pattern has got a bad reputation over the years due to be widely overused in the incorrect use cases. With the proliferation of microservices, <strong>have APIs become the new singleton?</strong></p><p>APIs, or application programming interfaces, have become a ubiquitous part of modern software development. They allow different systems and applications to communicate with one another, enabling the creation of complex, interconnected systems that can share data and functionality. However, there has been a growing concern that APIs are being overused, leading to a proliferation of unnecessarily complex and fragile systems that are difficult to maintain and scale.</p><p>One reason for the perceived overuse of APIs is the ease with which they can be implemented. With the abundance of API management tools and frameworks available, it is relatively straightforward to expose a set of functionality as an API and make it available to other systems. This has led to a proliferation of APIs, many of which are redundant or unnecessary, adding unnecessary complexity to the overall system.</p><p>Another issue is the lack of standardization in the API ecosystem. Each API is typically designed to meet the specific needs of the system it was created for, resulting in a wide variety of different designs and conventions. This can make it difficult for developers to understand and use APIs from other systems, as they may have to learn and adapt to new conventions and patterns each time they encounter a new API.</p><p>In addition to these issues, the reliance on APIs can also lead to fragile systems that are difficult to maintain and scale. When multiple systems are tightly coupled through APIs, a change to one system can have cascading effects on others, leading to unexpected behavior and potential failures. This can make it difficult to make changes or updates to a system without the risk of breaking something else.</p><p>There are also concerns about the security of APIs. As they allow systems to communicate with one another, they can also provide a potential entry point for attackers to gain access to sensitive data or functionality. Properly securing APIs can be a complex and time-consuming task, and if not done correctly, can lead to significant vulnerabilities.</p><p>So what can be done to address these issues? One solution is to use APIs more judiciously, carefully evaluating whether an API is truly necessary before implementing it. This can help reduce the overall complexity of the system and make it easier to maintain and scale. Another solution is to adopt API design standards and guidelines, which can help ensure that APIs are consistent and easy to understand and use. Finally, proper API security practices should be implemented to protect against potential vulnerabilities.</p><p>In conclusion, while APIs have become an essential part of modern software development, there is a growing concern that they are being overused, leading to unnecessarily complex and fragile systems that are difficult to maintain and scale. To address this issue, it is important to use APIs more judiciously, adopt design standards and guidelines, and implement proper security practices. By doing so, we can create more robust and scalable systems that can better meet the needs of users and businesses.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/webdev">webdev</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/api">api</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/architecture">architecture</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2022/12/19/macroInfrastructure-microservice-obsesion">Double-edge Microservices: MacroInfrastructure due Microservice Obsesion</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-12-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 19, 2022</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/kanekotic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/kanekotic.png" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kanekotic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Engineering Manager @ClimatePartner</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-context">The Context<a class="hash-link" href="#the-context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Cloud and infrastructure as code have revolutionized our industry. They allowed us to be able to procure infrastructure in a simple, adaptable way.<br>
<!-- -->This allowed us to move from writing huge monolithic applications to write microservices that interact between them.<br>
<!-- -->One of the most accepted definition of a microservice can be expressed as:</p><blockquote><p>A self-contained portion of code that does not share resources with other services, can be deployed independently, and should be easy to rewrite in a small portion of time.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds great when we talk about individual parts of a software projects. Nevertheless, when thinking about systems and how they operate, There is a point to make about granularity as software does never work fully isolated. It requires interactions with other systems to fulfill their purpose.</p><p>Most of the monolithic applications of the past had an issue of being over-engineered to allow changes that might never happen.</p><p>Could that also happen with microservices?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issues">The Issues<a class="hash-link" href="#the-issues" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="clarity-of-the-domain">Clarity Of The Domain<a class="hash-link" href="#clarity-of-the-domain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When a system grows too much in small pieces, it becomes more and more complex to understand the big picture.<br>
<!-- -->When pieces are too small, domain events start becoming exchange of information in between nodes of a network. All this removes cohesion on the knowledge over the domain of a system, making it difficult to grasp the real intention and capabilities of concepts and actors across a system.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="babel-tower-issue">Babel tower Issue<a class="hash-link" href="#babel-tower-issue" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The more parts a system has, the less heterogeneous it becomes. This at the same time translates into a more complex environment with more integrations, frameworks and bigger learning curves that affects delivery. There need to be a balance of when and where in a system a new technology is added. Decisions must be based on needs and not on preferences.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implicit-runtime-dependencies">Implicit runtime dependencies<a class="hash-link" href="#implicit-runtime-dependencies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The more a system get split, the more dependency on certain node it will have. This tends to cause more dependencies in between the pieces of your infrastructure-based puzzle where you start having god infrastructure points that become single point of failure, or you have a chain of dependent infra that need to be deployed in a go or certain order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hidden-complexity">Hidden Complexity<a class="hash-link" href="#hidden-complexity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The more your microservice environment grows, the more it requires a growing support infrastructure for monitoring, alerting and other services not used as part of the main system. This normally is a separate effort which has its cost. The more a system grows, those hidden complexities become a dependency for all the nodes in the system, making it a complex task to evolve and change those dependencies.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-if-yagni">Why… if YAGNI<a class="hash-link" href="#why-if-yagni" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the main ideas of microservices was to be able to validate assumptions fast. Before bootstrapping new services or infrastructure, there is a need to ask ourselves about the existence of a service or infrastructure that contains the domain knowledge required for the experiment in the current ecosystem. If we are not careful, experiments won&#x27;t be experiments. They will be MVPs, where domain knowledge is re-implemented, just for having it as a standalone node on the system.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="repeating-yourself">Repeating Yourself<a class="hash-link" href="#repeating-yourself" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When we create pieces of code that are independent, there is always a certain level of bootstrapping that is required and repeated in each node of our systems. This will cause not only a set of duplicated code, but also has a development time cost attached to it. Bootstrapping a project in a high granularity system can be complex to standardize.</p><p>Microservices, the cloud, and infrastructure as a service have definitely revolutionized our industry, nevertheless as in everything there is a need for balance. Making sure we use the right tool for the job, and we don&#x27;t over-engineer things, not only at a code level but also at infrastructure level, as everything has a cost.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, a macro infrastructure due to microservice obsession can lead to increased complexity and overhead costs, as well as challenges in making changes and updates to the system. While microservices can offer benefits such as increased scalability and flexibility, it is important for organizations to carefully consider their specific needs and choose the right level of granularity for their architecture.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/webdev">webdev</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/api">api</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/programming">programming</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/architecture">architecture</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2022/11/24/tdd-is-not-called-tdt-for-a-reason">TDD is not called TDT for a reason</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-11-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 24, 2022</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/kanekotic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/kanekotic.png" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kanekotic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Engineering Manager @ClimatePartner</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have observed quite a few articles lately that elaborate on issues with TDD.
