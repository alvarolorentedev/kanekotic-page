There tend to be more efficient solutions like over the shoulder reviews or also pair programming.\nWith this 2 points we would be at parity with the PR value. Nevertheless PR's have a hidden cost in trust environments. One of this costs is related to ownership. Writing code that is broken in a branch does not affect anyone, at the same point some of the responsibility of validation goes to the reviewer that without the specifics need to validate if things are correct or not. We know humans suck at this, so why not let this to machines handle the responsibility?\nThe other hidden cost can be measure in throughput. PR's tend to wait and accumulate the more complex a change is the more it takes to merge it. Meaning the more time it takes to get to production.
